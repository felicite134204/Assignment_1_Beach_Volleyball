<h1>Project Plan</h1>
<p>Name: Felicite Kazadi</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The altimate goal of the website is to increase the number of customers by at least 50%, by making more people  aware of the company's existance and services. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation </h2>
<p>The website will be suceessful if the company achieves at least a 50% increase in customers, following the release of the website. New memebers will be informally asked about how they became aware of the campany's services, and based on their feedback, conclusions will be made on whether or not the website is doing its job. Another way of evaluating the website's success will be by counting the number of people who register online after a certain period of time. </p>
<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>The target audience include males and female of 15 to 30 years of age.</p>
<p>The website will be primarily designed to appeal to the target audience, and this will be accentuated though a variety of images.</p>
